# Final Recommendations

## 1. UX & Website Optimization

### Don't Touch the Checkout Flow
- **Recommendation**: The conversion rates from **Checkout Start → Purchase** are excellent (~80%+). This indicates that the technical payment flow is frictionless.
- **Action**: **Do not redesign** the checkout page right now; you risk breaking something that is working perfectly.

## 2. Marketing Strategy

### Stop Over-Investing in Social for Sales
- **Recommendation**: Social Media is driving 30% of our traffic (Volume) but has the lowest conversion rate (Efficiency). We are likely paying for "window shoppers."
- **Action**: Shift budget away from "Traffic" objectives on social ads and focus on **Retargeting** or **Lead Gen** to capture emails instead.

### Double Down on Email Marketing
- **Recommendation**: Email is our highest converting channel (~13%+ conversion rate vs ~6% for Social).
- **Action**: Implement an aggressive email capture popup for those high-volume Social visitors. If we can get them onto our email list, our data proves they are far more likely to buy later.

## 3. Financial & Revenue

### Audit Ad Spend against AOV
- **Recommendation**: We found our Average Order Value (AOV) is ~$115.
- **Action**: Set a strict **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)** limit. If we are paying more than $30–$40 to acquire a customer via Social Media ads (which convert poorly), we are likely losing money on those specific transactions.
